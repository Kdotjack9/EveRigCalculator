This is a simple application that will calculate how many rigs you can make with a given pile of salvage.
Use:
Edit settings.xml to re-name your input/output files and set your Production Efficiency level.
Input defaults to input.csv
Output defaults to output.csv
Production Efficiency level defaults to 5 (0% waste)

Run the application with the RigBuilder.bat. 
This will generate an output file in csv format that will have the filename that you specified.
The output file will tell you how many of each rig type you can make at your efficiency level.

Please contact Jack Tahrren if you find any significant bugs.

Disclaimer: This application is very simple and hacked together in about 4 hours total development time.
If you have requests for additional features, they will be listened to, however I cannot promise anything
as, like most people, my time is valuable. This does not mean I will not improve this app, this means that
I will be more likely to improve upon it if I am offered compensation for my time.

Disclaimer to Disclaimer: If you break this app because you mess with it trying to get it to work because
"this developer is stupid" then shame on you. I will seriously consider all reports of bugs, but also know
that if unsubstantiated, I will ridicule you in the most public way possible. This application project is
available for open source download as an eclipse project for free via github, if you are really curious about 
how I did what I did.
